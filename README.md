👋 Hello, I'm Tales Melo, a Law graduate. However, my passion for programming led me to explore the field of Information Technology. Fascinated by computers and curious about how programs work and are developed, I decided to pursue a career in this wonderful area. Currently, I'm studying Systems Analysis and Development at INFNET. I've worked as a Junior Full-stack Developer, working on both front-end and back-end, primarily using React with Typescript and Node.js.


🌱 I've had experience with various programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, and React. Although I've also had some exposure to Java and C#, the language I identify with the most and intend to specialize in is Python.

🖥️ I'm always looking for opportunities to collaborate on projects to enhance my skills and knowledge, aiming for constant growth.
